      <span class="hobby">Hobby 1: Biking</span>
      <p>
        Biking is a hobby that offers both physical and mental benefits. It's a
        versatile activity that can be enjoyed solo for peace and reflection or
        in groups for social interaction. With different types of bikes
        available, it caters to various terrains and preferences, from leisurely
        rides in parks to adventurous road cycling.

    <div id="hobby2">
      <span class="hobby">Hobby 2: Singing</span>
      <p>
        Singing is one of my most cherished hobbies, offering a profound and
        soulful way to express emotions and tell stories. It transcends mere
        vocal performance, serving as a conduit for conveying feelings and
        experiences that often words alone cannot. Whether it's the thrill of
        hitting the perfect high note or the quiet joy of a softly sung melody,
        singing provides a sense of liberation and creativity.

    <div id="hobby3">
      <span class="hobby">Hobby 3: Traveling</span>
      <p>
        Traveling is a hobby that I hold dear, as it's a gateway to experiencing
        new cultures, landscapes, and ways of life. It's about stepping out of
        the familiar and immersing oneself in the diversity of the world. Each
        journey is an adventure, filled with the excitement of exploring unknown
        places, tasting different cuisines, and meeting new people.
